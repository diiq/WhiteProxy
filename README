I get distracted very easily, and when I am looking up something
important, I don't like spending my willpower avoiding distractions:
facebook, my email, comics, youtube, twitter ---- all the ten-thousand
things. 

What could I do? I wrote a little proxy server that block all content
unrelated to the task at hand. It even takes the time to look up
related words, so that it won't block anything important. It also only
gives me ten minutes of access --- plenty of time to open some
documentation, not enough time to open 50 tabs of vaguely related
journal articles.

I don't reccomend using this all the time --- sometimes free
association hyperlinking is very valuable --- but when the job needs
doing, I don't need distracting. So I threw together WhiteProxy.

Necessary Accoutrements:

python 2.6 or greater
twisted, the python server library


Quickstart: 

1. Set your browser to use the proxy: localhost:8080
2. python prox.py -p 8080 "twisted api" 
3. Hurry up and surf, you have ten minutes.


prox.cgi, index.html, and prox.js are a sketch of what this might look
like if it wished it were pretty. If you'd like to use the web
interface, you'll also need a local server capable of running python
cgi scripts.
